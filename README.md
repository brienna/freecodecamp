## [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com):

For most sections, I post all completed exercises. 

Sections for which I post only exercises that either made me pause to think or used a feature I was unfamiliar with:

* Basic JavaScript
* Object Oriented and Functional Programming
* HTML5 and CSS
